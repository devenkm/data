Here's your Investing Action Plan for Wednesday: what you need to know as an investor for the coming day. Crude oil prices are nearing the highest levels since November 2014 ahead of renewed Iran sanctions next month. That's put Big Oil stocks Chevron (CVX), Total (TOT), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA), Eni (E) and BP (BP) near buy points, seeking to join Exxon Mobil (XOM).
					 				 			 Despite rising oil prices, Exxon Mobil is reportedly looking at selling the bulk of its U.S. Gulf of Mexico assets, according to Reuters, as the gulf becomes less reliable for major oil finds.
As Exxon seeks buyers, Exxon Mobil stock is already in buy range, rising 0.8% to 86.46 Tuesday.
EIA Crude Oil Inventory, Production DataThe Energy Information Administration will report weekly domestic crude stockpile and production data at 10:30 a.m. ET. Inventories are seen rising by 2.76 million barrels, a second straight week of increases, according to analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts.
U.S. crude fell 7 cents to $75.23 per barrel after hitting four-year highs Monday. Brent was off 0.2% to $84.80 after topping $85 Monday.
Chevron StockChevron stock rose 0.3% to 124.74 on the stock market today. The oil major is forming a cup with handle with a 131.18 entry point. The cup with handle is one of the most successful bases out of the eight that IBD identifies.
But one weak spot is the oil major's 69 EPS Rating, which tracks quarterly and annual earnings growth. Investors should look for the rating to rise to 80 or better to show it's in the top 20% of all stocks.
Total StockFrance's Total dipped 0.8% to 64.91. But the stock is still forming a flat base with a 65.79 buy point. A flat base reflects unusual strength; instead of falling, it holds steady for weeks or even months.
The stock has an 86 IBD SmartSelect Composite Rating, but top stocks should have ratings of 95 or higher.
BP StockBP rose 0.1% to 46.81, also forming a flat base with a 47.93 entry point.
The U.K. oil major is ranked No. 4 in IBD's Oil & Gas-Integrated group.
Royal Dutch Shell StockShell shares dipped 0.3% to 69.09, in a lopsided double-bottom base with a 71.95 entry point.
Double-bottom bases can be tricky to identify. For a true base, the stock will rebound back near highs, then sell off a second time. And during that decline, the stock must undercut the first low.
While the base looks good, Shell only has a 64 Composite Rating.
Eni StockItaly's Eni edged 0.1% lower to 37.84, forming a flat base with a 40.25 buy point. But Eni has an extremely weak 32 EPS rating.
